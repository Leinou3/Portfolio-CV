            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a 21-year-old third-year university of applied sciences student eager to gain new work experience. 
            I actively seek out opportunities that allow me to experience new things. As an employee, I am punctual, precise, and reliable, and I get along well with everyone. 
            My hobbies, particularly as a judo and scout team leader, have provided me with valuable leadership experience. 
            I enjoy teamwork and am interested in project work, aiming to find a role where I can see my contributions. 
            My interest in various tasks was confirmed during my time in work planning at Ardor Oy and as an engineering student at Auramarine Oy.</p>
